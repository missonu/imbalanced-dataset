# Here is some methods to handle Imbalanced Dataset


My key observations:

1. Some classifiers such as Random forest is obserevd to work better for Imbalanced dataset
2. Undersampling method does not always perform better. It might work good with small size datasets
3. Oversampling method works better with large size dataset
4. SMOTE works very similar to Oversampling by default, but it can be tuned to work like undersampler.
5. Ensamble methods using Adaboost can be used to perform classification for Imbalanced datasets.
